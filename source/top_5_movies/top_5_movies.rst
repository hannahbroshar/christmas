    *A Christmas Story* is a classic Christmas movie that has
    been around for what seems like forever. All Ralphie is 
    worried about this Christmas is escaping from his bullies
    and getting his Red Ryder BB Gun! The movie is a comical family Christmas movie.

**Home Alone**

    *1990*
    
    Oops, maybe cheating the system with this number 2 spot! *Home Alone* and its sequels are all fun Christmas movies
    to remind families each year how much they mean to another,
    even if you do forget a child every now and then. These 
    movies are filled with funny, action, and family moments!

**The Santa Claus**

    *1994*
    
    This might count as cheating again because one
    cannot simply include the first *The Santa Clause* without including all of them, so number 3 on this just so happens 
    to be a 3-in-1 deal! Tim Allen plays the perfect Santa in 
    each film, you just have to decide for yourself, do you prefer nice Charlie or bad boy Charlie?
    
**How The Grinch Stole Christmas**

    I know mine does, how could it not?! *How The Grinch Stole Christmas* is a movie for all ages that has some humor to 
    it but also teaches people about the true meaning of Christmas.
