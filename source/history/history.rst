The History behind Christmas
============================


Christmas is a worldwide recognized phenomenon. The holiday
has been practiced in both religious and secular natures.
More than likely if you are Christian or were raised in a
Christian household, you have experienced the celebration
of the Christmas season. More often than not the holiday is
recognized by Christians as the birthday of Jesus of Nazareth,
a highly influential and spiritual figure who basically taught
the basis of the Christian religion. Some of the most popular
traditions include giving gifts, decorating a Christmas tree,
baking cookies, sharing meals with family, and attending church.
Christmas Day, December 25th, has been a federal holiday in the
U.S.A since 1870.

    Back in Scandinavia, the Norse celebrated a the winter solstice
    as well, but they named it Yule. This celebration went through
    December 21 all the way through January. They did this to show
    express their feelings of happiness at the return of the sun.
    A tradition often practiced is fathers and sons would hunt for
    and bring home very large logs to set on fire. While the log was
    ablaze, the people would feast. This event could last up to almost
    12 whole days! They had the belief that each spark that emanated
    from the log represented new cattle that would be born in the
    coming year.

    Saturnalia Poster

    Back in Rome they had a holiday named Saturnalia. This was a
    celebration in honor of the god of agriculture, Saturn. The
    occurs during the winter solstice and continues for a whole month.
    This event was a hedonistic time. This means that food and drink
    were plentiful and the basic Roman caste system was turned upside
    down. For the entire month slaves were masters, and the lowly
    peasants controlled the city. Businesses and schools were all shut
    down so that everybody had the opportunity to enjoy the season.
