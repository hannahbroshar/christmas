**Clothes** – Kids grow fast so they constantly need new clothes. 
Since they need new clothes you might as well get them some for Christmas. 
It might not be as exciting as toys, but kids forget about toys after a little
while anywas. Getting them clothes is a useful worthwile gift. You can also 
make getting kids clothes fun, have them try them on for everyone, and if they 
are girls, have them do a “fashion show” for you in their new clothes. 

**Getting them a trip** – My parents did this many time for us. We would have a
really big box and it would be a piece of paper that we had to dig through 
the box to find. The paper would say something like “this summer we are going
to a cool location and we will be doing this or that.”
