Do you ever get tired of needing to constantly supply the
young ones with non-stop attention? It's almost as if they
have an endless amount of energy most days. Well if you're
somebody who needs a break or is out of ideas to keep them
busy, here's a list of 5 things for them to do over the holidays.

**1. Gingerbread House Making**

    This is always a hit with the kids. This one is truly a classic
    tradition that nearly every one has at least once in their life
    taken part in. One of the great pros about this activity is that
    it really engages the creative side of children and allows them
    to put their energy into something productive. Make sure to have
    plenty of candy and icing when the house is ready for decorating
    because they might go a little overboard.

    You can find a great recipe and guide on the `Food Network website`_.

    Sugar cookies are one of the easiest baking activities one can take
    part it. They'll even be done and ready for decorating in 30 minutes
    or less! After they're made, just get some icing, sprinkles, candy,
    etc. for your kids to decorate them with.

**3. Bark**

    This is one of my personal favorites if I have to be completely
    honest. There will be a link below showing how it's made, but the recipe
    is almost completely customizable. You can change out the
    chocolates used and you can change or leave out the fruit and
    nuts used as well. Two good methods to remember if you want to different
    flavors mixed is either loosely stirring them into one another before
    pouring, or you can pour one layer, then let it dry, and pour the second
    layer.

    Here's how to make your own `bark at home`_.

**4. Customized Ornaments**

    One of the most reoccurring activities that I would do as a kid
    was custom made Christmas ornaments. All you'll need for this one
    is clear glass bulb ornaments, some ribbons to hang them when
    they're finished, paint, and some paint brushes. All you'll have to
    do is supervise and show them how to work a paint brush.

    Here's a `walkthrough`_ the activity along with some examples as well.

    Another crazy simple project for all ages is a do it yourself snow
    globe. One of the good things about this particular project is that
    it looks super complicated, but is actually super easy and is very
    affordable.

    Here's a `link`_ to the full walkthrough.
