**Holiday Baking**


    Holidays are meant for stuffing our faces and 
    stretching our clothes, so it's no surprise 
    that baking can be considered a tradition. A
    day spent hanging out in the kitchen with your
    grandma, mother or whoever making homemade dough 
    and frosting and being covered in flour and 
    sprinkles by the end of it seems like a typical
    baking session.

**Finding the Perfect Tree**


    Bundle up and bring your saw!
    Loading the vehicle up and heading to your
    favorite tree farm to find the perfect Christmas
    tree is a tradition a lot of families engage in.

    

**Decorating the tree**


    Once you've found the perfect tree it is time to decorate it! Gathering the whole family to help make sure each 
    ornament is in the most perfect spot is essential!
    
    
**Family Movie Night**


    Make a fire in the fireplace, load a plate up with
    the cookies you've made, fill a mug with hot chocolate,
    wrap up in a cozy blanket and watch all the Christmas 
    movies you can! What a cool and relaxing holiday tradition
    many families enjoy doing together.
