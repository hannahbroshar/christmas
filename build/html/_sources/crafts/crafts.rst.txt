*Making a Santa –* Use the paper plate as a face and use cotton balls to make Santa’s beard by gluing them to the paper plate. Next take red paper and cut out a Santa hat and glue one cotton ball at the top. Finally use buttons, markers or paint to make the face.

*Making a tree –* First get the paper plate into 3 pieces like a piece of pizza. Next glue the 3 pieces together with all the triangles going in one direction with an even spacing and now you have a tree. Paint the pieces green and now you have a tree to decorate with paint, buttons, or beads.

*Making ornaments for the tree –* The first one is easy fold up paper and make random cuts to make one of a find snowflake and us the string to hang on the tree. Next take empty toilet paper rolls and let the kids get creative and decorate them. Then hang them on the tree.
