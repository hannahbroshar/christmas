    The song tends to be less traditional and more comical. This doesn't mean
    that it doesn't still relate to many families around the holiday season, 
    surely more families relate to this song more than they would like to admit.
    
    The popular Christmas tune "Merry Christmas From The Family" was      originally written by Robert Earl Keith in 1994. Since then many      artists have done their own covers of the song. Those artists include: Montgomery Gentry, Rosie O'Donnell with the Dixie Chicks, and Jill Sobule.

    Coming in at the number 3 spot is Michael Bublé's cover of "It's Beginning to Look A Lot Like Christmas". Bublé's heavenly voice makes for a great cover of
    any Christmas song.
    
    The song was originally released by Meredith Wilson in 1951 but like
    many other Christmas songs has been performed by several other 
    artists. Bublé in particular, released his cover in 2011 on his 
    album *Christmas*.

    Last but certainly not least we have "The 12 Days of Christmas". 
    This has been a holiday favorite over the years, that is if people
    can remember all 12 gifts and not just **FIVE GOLDEN RINGS!**
    
    The song actually originated in England in 1780 as a chant rather
    than a song. Then in 1909 was transformed into a song by Frederic Austin.
