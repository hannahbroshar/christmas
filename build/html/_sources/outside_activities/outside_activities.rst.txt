Outside Activities
==================

If you have ever participated in classic Christmas
traditions, then you will surely be familiar with
some of the items on the list. Here are some wholesome
outside activities for the whole family during the
Christmas season.


**Christmas tree hunting**


    Wether your family has been doing it for years
    or you're just getting into it, going on the
    hunt for a Christmas tree for the house is
    always a blast, and a great way to spend time
    with your family. There are loads of varieties
    of plastic Christmas trees, but honestly you
    just can't beat the originality of owning a
    real life Christmas tree.

**Hanging up Christmas lights**


    This is always a fun one for my family and I.
    Every year we hang up lights all around the top
    of the house, and we even put some on the bushes
    in the front of the house. This is really fun
    especially because of how creative you can
    get with it.

**Setting up lawn decorations**


    This activity is another great way to express your
    creativity. There are so many different types of
    lawn decorations that it's hard to count. You could
    set up a nativity scene, make a runway for Santa,
    put up light-up animals, put up inflatable snowmen,
    the list goes on and on.

**Go out to see the Christmas lights**


    It is a pretty fair bet that your house is not the
    only one that is decorated for the season. A truly
    enjoyable time may be had driving around your local
    area and viewing the amazing display of lights your
    community has to offer. Sometimes, depending on where
    you live, the city may put up a display of lights of
    their own. Either way, this activity will never get old.
