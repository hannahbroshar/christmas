**Christmas Village**


    These adorable little glass fixtures have been 
    around for quite a while but still are a great
    way to decorate during the holiday season. They
    create the perfect winter scene!
    

**Wreath**


    Who doesn't love wreaths, and a Christmas one at that?! 
    Many people love to decorate fake wreaths to hang all 
    year round, but these Christmas time wreaths are just 
    beautiful! They seem to get more and more elaborate each
    year, by adding bows, ribbons, pinecones, ornaments and 
    whatever else one could think of!
    

**Christmas Lights**


    Whatever happened to the simple one strand of lights? HA!
    Those days are long gone for most, because the neighbors 
    have begun to step up their game and you can't be seen as
    the lazy neighborhood Grinch! Households are covering their entire homes in lights and using technology and local radio channels to put on light shows! That's right, you can tune into certain stations and watch as the lights correspond to the music on the radio, crazy!
    
    That's not all! There are light up, life-size outdoor decor such as reindeer and Santa's!
    
**Christmas Tree**


    Can't leave out one of the symbolic decorations of the
    holiday season, the Christmas Tree! Whether your team 
    white lights or colored lights everyone can agree they
    are such a beautiful addition to any home during these
    cold December days.
