<h1>The History behind Christmas<a class="headerlink" href="#the-history-behind-christmas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Christmas is a worldwide recognized phenomenon. The holiday
has been practiced in both religious and secular natures.
More than likely if you are Christian or were raised in a
Christian household, you have experienced the celebration
of the Christmas season. More often than not the holiday is
recognized by Christians as the birthday of Jesus of Nazareth,
a highly influential and spiritual figure who basically taught
the basis of the Christian religion. Some of the most popular
traditions include giving gifts, decorating a Christmas tree,
baking cookies, sharing meals with family, and attending church.
Christmas Day, December 25th, has been a federal holiday in the
U.S.A since 1870.</p>
<p><strong>Christmas wasn’t always what it is today</strong></p>

<p>For centuries before the arrival of Jesus, early Europeans
celebrated the middle of the winter season. Many of them
had great joy throughout the winter solstice.</p>

<p>Back in Scandinavia, the Norse celebrated a the winter solstice
as well, but they named it Yule. This celebration went through
December 21 all the way through January. They did this to show
express their feelings of happiness at the return of the sun.
A tradition often practiced is fathers and sons would hunt for
and bring home very large logs to set on fire. While the log was
ablaze, the people would feast. This event could last up to almost
12 whole days! They had the belief that each spark that emanated
from the log represented new cattle that would be born in the
coming year.</p>

<p>Saturnalia Poster</p>
<p>Back in Rome they had a holiday named Saturnalia. This was a
celebration in honor of the god of agriculture, Saturn. The
occurs during the winter solstice and continues for a whole month.
This event was a hedonistic time. This means that food and drink
were plentiful and the basic Roman caste system was turned upside
down. For the entire month slaves were masters, and the lowly
peasants controlled the city. Businesses and schools were all shut
down so that everybody had the opportunity to enjoy the season.</p>
