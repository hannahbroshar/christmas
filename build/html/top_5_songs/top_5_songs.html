<h1>Top 5 Christmas Song<a class="headerlink" href="#top-5-christmas-song" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>All I Want For Christmas Is You</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><img alt="top_5_songs/song1.jpg" src="top_5_songs/song1.jpg" />
<p>According to Billboard’s Holiday 100 “All I want for Christmas”
by Mariah Carey comes in at number 1! The song as been at the
number one spot for 30 weeks now, and has been on the chart for
35!</p>
<p>Mariah Carey’s hit holiday jingle was released November 1st, 1994.
It seems to be a favorite every holiday season, reminding all of
the love birds out there exacty what their significant other is
wanting for the season.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Merry Christmas From The Family</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><img alt="top_5_songs/song2.jpg" src="top_5_songs/song2.jpg" />
<p>The song tends to be less traditional and more comical. This doesn’t mean
that it doesn’t still relate to many families around the holiday season,
surely more families relate to this song more than they would like to admit.</p>
<p>The popular Christmas tune “Merry Christmas From The Family” was      originally written by Robert Earl Keith in 1994. Since then many      artists have done their own covers of the song. Those artists include: Montgomery Gentry, Rosie O’Donnell with the Dixie Chicks, and Jill Sobule.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>It’s Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><img alt="top_5_songs/song3.jpg" src="top_5_songs/song3.jpg" />
<p>Coming in at the number 3 spot is Michael Bublé’s cover of “It’s Beginning to Look A Lot Like Christmas”. Bublé’s heavenly voice makes for a great cover of
any Christmas song.</p>
<p>The song was origially released by Meredith Wilson in 1951 but like
many other Christmas songs has been performed by several other
artists. Bublé in particular, released his cover in 2011 on his
album <em>Christmas</em>.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Santa Claus Is Coming To Town</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><img alt="top_5_songs/song4.jpg" src="top_5_songs/song4.jpg" />
<p>The classic tune that seems to make it’s way into almost every Christmas
movie and teaches kids all about Santa and his list checking habits!</p>
<p>“Santa Claus Is Coming To Town” was released back in 1934 and was written
by John Frderick Coots and Haven Gillespie.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>The 12 Days of Christmas</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><img alt="top_5_songs/song5.jpg" src="top_5_songs/song5.jpg" />
<p>Last but certainly not least we have “The 12 Days of Christmas”.
This has been a holiday favorite over the years, that is if people</p>
<blockquote>
<div>can remember all 12 gifts and not just <strong>FIVE GOLDEN RINGS!</strong></div></blockquote>
<p>The song actually originated in England in 1780 as a chant rather
than a song. Then in 1909 was tranformed into a song by Frederic Austin.</p>
